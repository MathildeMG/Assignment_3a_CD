Week 4 Assignment: Collecting Data

The dataset is a Chronological Table of Epidemic and Pandemic Events in human History. It contains different colums: 

Event / Date / Location / Disease / Deathtoll / Reference

Althogh I think this dataset is interesting, I think it's not well formatted, which limits the exploration that one can do in it. I think the dataset could use a reformatting using more consitents manner to note the values. There are often elements in ( ) which could be noted differently and the numbers are often not integers so it's difficult to make a vizualisation of the deathtolls for example. 
We know that the method used to collect the data is web scraping and the source is the Wikipedia page of lists of epidemics and pandemics. There is no information on the authors. 

The questions asked are the following: 
- **What locations and years are associated with recorded instances of the Bubonic Plague in the dataset?**
- **What is the most common location recorded in the dataset for epidemics, and how many instances have been reported in that location?**
- **What is the location with the least number of recorded instances of epidemics, and how many instances have been reported in that location?**
- **Which locations have had more than 2 instances of Smallpox, and how many instances were recorded in each of those locations?**

The vizualisation shows the following: 
- **Vizualisation of the number of instances for the selected countries: China, Spain, Italy, England, France and Russia.**
