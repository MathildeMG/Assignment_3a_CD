Week 4 Assignment: Collecting Data

The dataset is a Chronological Table of Epidemic and Pandemic Events in human History. It contains different colums: 

Event / Date / Location / Disease / Deathtoll / Reference

Althogh I thibk this dataset is interesting, I think it's not well formatted, which limits the exploration that one can do in it. I think the dataset could use a reformatting using more consitents manner to note the values. We know that the method used to collect the data is web scraping and the source is the Wikipedia page of lists of epidemics and pandemics. There is no information on the authors.
